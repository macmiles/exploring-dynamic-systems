Particle Simulation Playground: Exploring Random Motion, Interacting Bodies, and Orbital Physics

## Motivation

This project was developed as a fun exercise to explore the basic principles of particle physics using matplotlib's animation method. It started as a personal endeavor, but I'm making it public because I thought it might have merit as a fun-project/educational-resource for others as well. 

The models are presented sequentially in a Jupyter Notebook. Feel free to explore, experiment, and have fun with the code!

## Models

The jupyter notebook includes the following models:

1. Random Particles: This model demonstrates the spontaneous motion of particles within a 2d space. It offers an illustration of a universe where particles don't interact with each other.
2. Orbital Physics: This model applies Newton's Law of Gravitation to simulate the physics of interacting bodies. By visualizing this, we can begin to can gain insights into the complex dynamics of interacting systems in space.
3. Milky Way Simulation: This model aims to combine the previous concepts to simulate the orbital physics of our solar system. Using Newton's Law of Gravitation and the principles of of physics we can explore the dynamics of celestial bodies.

## Getting Started

To run these simulation models, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (specified in the notebook files)
