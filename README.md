# Exploring Dynamic Systems
Random Motion, Interacting Bodies, and Orbital Physics

## Motivation

This mini-project was developed as a fun way to explore some of the basic principles of interacting systems using Numpy & Matplotlib. The repo is public in the hopes that someone out there finds value in the notebook. Feel free to experiment and play with the code!

## Overview

The notebook includes the following:

### 1. Random Particles
This model illustrates the motion of objects in a 2d space, where all particles are independent of one another.

### 2. Orbital Physics
Newton's Law of Gravitation is used to simulate the physics of interacting bodies. This model allows us to gain insights into the complexity of dynamic systems.

### 3. Milky Way Sim
This model combines the previous concepts to simulate the orbital physics of our solar system. Using the principles of physics and the properties of each planet (mass, size, position, velocity) we explore the dynamics of celestial bodies.
