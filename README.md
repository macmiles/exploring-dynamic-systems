Particle Simulation Playground: Exploring Random Motion, Interacting Bodies, and Orbital Physics

## Motivation

This mini-project was developed as a way to explore some of the principles of interacting systems using Numpy & Matplotlib. I'm sharing the notebook in hopes that others will find it semi-useful and/or educational. Feel free to explore, experiment, and have fun with the code!

## Overview

The notebook includes the following:

1. Random Particles: This demonstrates the motion of particles in a 2d space. Offers an illustration of a world where particles are independent of one another.

2. Orbital Physics: Newton's Law of Gravitation is used to simulate the physics of interacting bodies. With this model, we can begin to understand the complex dynamics of systems in space.

3. Milky Way: This model combines the previous concepts to simulate the orbital physics of our solar system. Using the principles of physics and the properties of each planet (mass, size, position, velocity) we can explore the dynamics of celestial bodies.
